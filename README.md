<H1>Hello World! - Introduction

This a personal portfolio created during the [Data-Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science)-~~Course~~**Bootcamp** at [WBS Coding School.](https://www.wbscodingschool.com/data-science-bootcamp-part-time) 

It displays some of my work and archievements during this 26+two weeks of progress and enlightment. And data science. And python. And a lot of ***fun***! :smile:

<H1> The Primer
Right before the beginning of the cource, we learnt the basisc of 

 - Statistics
 - SQL 
 - Tableau

SQL stand for Structured Query Languange and help to get data out of loads of information. 
It is very useful. It's unique in adapting human language, syntax and sematics, e.g.:

Tableau is a mighty software not only to visualize but even more to storify data to lead to insights...

Simple, yet not easy. 

<H1>First steps

In the first two was to get to know about 

 1. SQL 
 2. visualizing data
 3. team-collaboraton
 4. presentation. 

So we startet with a real-world business usecase.

Tableau gives the possibility to share your stuff with the world and eternity. So let's do this.

Just kidding - a complete file with my first attemps to use Tableau for visualisation of [Donut-Charts](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/markus.p4574/viz/Magist_170424/Tech-Bubbles?publish=yes), [Waffle-Charts](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/markus.p4574/viz/Magist_170424/Waffle20x12?publish=yes), Line-Charts (i used the Dashboard-feature to create [Line-Chart with custom Forecast](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/markus.p4574/viz/Magist_170424/Dashboard6?publish=yes) !!)


After two intense weeks, out team finished our presentation during the last minutes. This was a wonderful experience. 
We used Google Slides to condense our conclusions and create the final presentation.
